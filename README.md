# Facial-Keypoints-Detection
In this project, I combined computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. 

**These applications include:**
- Facial tracking
- Facial pose recognition
- Facial filters
- Emotion recognition. 

## libraries and framework
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- pillow
- scipy

to install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Dataset
All of the data needed to train a neural network is in the in the subdirectory `data`. In this folder are training and tests set of image/keypoint data, and their respective csv files.
